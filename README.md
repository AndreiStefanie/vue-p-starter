## Commands
- **npm run serve** - run the application in development mode
- **npm run build** - build the application for deployment (_dist_ folder; it uses by default the _modern_ feature of the build plugin)
- **npm run analyze-bundle** - build and generate the bundle report

## Why another starter template?
It's true that we already have a lot of options for getting started with Vue (or any other js framework for that matter) which is both amazing and overwelming. However, everytime I started a project, I found myself setting up pretty much the same environment which I know I can rely on. This is my battle-tested environment and I am sure it will provide a solid foundation for your work too.

## Misc
You might also want to give Vue CLI UI a try. It's really cool.
You will need to install the Vue CLI:
`npm install -g @vue/cli` (if you are on UNIX systems admin rights might be required)
Execute the command `vue ui` which will open the Vue UI in the browser where you can **Import** the project (it's easier if you run the command in the project's root directory).
